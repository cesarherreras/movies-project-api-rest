## Getting Started

- Get the API Key from The movie DB API site. It's necessary to configure Axios settings.

                                //Axios instance
                                const api = axios.create({
                                    baseURL: 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/',
                                    headers: {
                                        'Content-Type':'application/json;charset=utf-8'
                                    },
                                    params: {
                                        'api_key': API_KEY,
                                        'language': definedLanguage
                                    }
                                });
